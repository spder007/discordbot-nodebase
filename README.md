# discordbot-nodebase
base for building discord bots in nodejs using discord.js v12 node v12  
this was thrown together in like 10 minute, fill out config and theres random filler in some stuff for names or channel ids    
prolly no memory leaks idk, make sure to install node modules which should be done in the start batch file   
oh also i didnt test this at all  
also this is v12 so dont even think about trying to use as a self bot; I am not to be held accountable for anything you do with this code.
